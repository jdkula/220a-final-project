      ## Wilbur
      **Wilbur Hall** is a large residence complex with 8 dorms inside of it:
      Arroyo, Cedro, Junipero (J-ro), Okada (Asian-American theme dorm),
      Otero (Public Service dorm), Rinconada (Rinc), Soto, and Trancos.

      There's a dining hall here where I took recordings. Click the blue pin to

            ## Inside Wilbur Dining Hall

            Wilbur dining hall is known mostly for its brunches and phở – although
            since COVID-19 I haven’t seen phở as often.

            This recording was taken on the east side of wilbur dining, during a
            Saturday dinner period. Moderately busy, but not *too* busy!

            Right on the west side of Wilbur, there’s a nice outdoor seating area that
            lies in the space between Trancos, Soto, Rinc, and Otero. You get a bit of the
            sound of others dining – especially since COVID-19, more people eat outside –
            mixed with the sounds of doors unlocking and opening, and bird song.

      Between two extrusions in EVGR B, there's a little couryard – there’s
      a grill, some trees (which house *very* chatty birds), a fire pit,
      and some benches for people to sit and work or gather at. (It’s also right
      next to a spot where you can pick up Color COVID tests!)

      I recorded this soundscape around 2PM on Tuesday 11/30, after dropping off a COVID test.

      Mirrielees, Wilbur, and Casper Quad. You’ll hear a lot of cars here – more
      cars than people, actually, although you’ll get the passing conversation
      or sound of bikers.

      There’s a road just south of Stern that separates the Munger grad housing
      and the Stern dorm complex. You get the occasional Uber or Lyft picking
      up or dropping off students here, or golf carts and University vehicles
      passing by on their way to who-knows-where, as well as the sound of
      students of all kinds walking to get to the Row, to their dorms, and/or
      towards Meyer Green, likely on their way to the library or central campus.

      I recorded this around 2:40PM on Tuesday 11/30.

      ## Lake Lag

      Ah, dry Lake Lagunita! While you won’t be able to hear the sound of water
      here, you will hear the sound of passersby, either taking a relaxing
      stroll around this more rural-looking part of Stanford’s campus, or 
      getting some exercise in. This was recorded on the side nearer to Lag
      housing, which means you may hear the sounds of vehicles and people
      moving food and other supplies in and out of the nearby dining hall.
      It was also recorded near Elliott Program Center, which has rooms students
      can reserve to use for whatever – if you listen closely, you might hear
      some music coming from there.

      ## AOREC Poolside

      AOREC is one of the gyms on campus (nearer to Florence Moore and GovCo).
      Some people call it “Farillaga” (if they live on East campus) or
      “Nearillaga” (if they live on West campus), to differentiate the two
      gyms available to them (the other one being ACSR – the "A" in both these
      acronyms stands for "Arillaga"). AOREC has an outdoor pool – you can hear
      the sounds of splishing and splashing as a bunch of folks hit the water
      to get their exercise and/or training in. You can also hear the sounds
      of water splashing over the edge of the pool into the drains that recycle
      the water.

      ## Terman Fountain

      Terman fountain is a bit of a nostalgic place for me – I came upon it
      randomly during Admit Weekend in the middle of all the hustle and bustle.
      It was miraculously empty, and quiet (aside from the sounds of the fountain
      itself, which washed away a lot of the other noises around campus). It was
      a nice place to just sit and be before picking myself up and going to the
      next thing!

            Lane Reading Room is a large room in the Bing Wing of Green Library.
            The room has a certain ~vibe~ to it that makes it a nice place to read,
            I just wish the chairs weren’t so creaky! You can hear the movement
            of students trying their best to focus and be quiet here.

            Just outside the Bing Wing of Green Library is a road that leads
            directly to the heart of Main Quad, as well as a road that connects
            north and south campus (a very well-travelled one – during peak
            class hours, you can count hundreds of students using this road
            to get from class to class). You can hear the excited sounds of
            people socializing here or getting from place to place – a stark
            contrast with the quietude and academic focus on Lane Reading Room.

      ## The bottom of the oval

      The oval! The site of most of Stanford’s iconic landscape pictures.
      It’s in many ways the start of the separation between main campus and 
      “the outside world.” You can hear cars and busses passing by to pick up
      and drop folks off, and on just the other side of this walkway hear the
      sound of many students getting from place to place.

      At one point, a couple entered a car right in front of the mic. At another
      point, some students walked up to inspect what this weird electronic device
      was doing hanging out near the oval.

      (Starbucks and a bunch of places to eat), the undergraduate package center,
      TAP (The Axe And Palm, a late-night eatery), the bookstore, and White Plaza.

            overlooks Main Quad (and is also a centerpiece of many of Stanford’s
            most iconic photos). On the backside (south side), there’s a road
            that many students use to transit to their classes (especially getting
            to the engineering quad or the Tresidder area). There is also
            a gate that allows authorized cars to get into the normally-restricted
            north side of campus.

            I recorded this around 6:10PM on Tuesday 11/30 – the sun had set,

            is open through about 2 AM, and I personally have spent *way* too
            much time here over the years. You can hear the sounds of people

            You often hear events happening in White Plaza, just south of the Claw.
            In this case, there was a Hanukkah celebration happening in the
            background while I was recording. The fountain itself was also off,
            which is relatively abnormal for this time on a Tuesday.
