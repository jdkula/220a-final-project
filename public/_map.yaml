      ## Wilbur
      **Wilbur Hall** is a large residence complex with 8 dorms inside of it:
      Arroyo, Cedro, Junipero (J-ro), Okada (Asian-American theme dorm),
      Otero (Public Service dorm), Rinconada (Rinc), Soto, and Trancos.

      There's a dining hall here where I took recordings. Click the blue pin to
      see in more detail!

            ## Inside Wilbur Dining Hall
            
            Wilbur dining hall is known mostly for its brunches and phở – although
            since COVID-19 I haven’t seen phở as often.

            This recording was taken on the east side of wilbur dining, during a
            Saturday dinner period. Moderately busy, but not *too* busy!

            ## Outside Wilbur Dining
            
            Right on the west side of Wilbur, there’s a nice outdoor seating area that
            lies in the space between Trancos, Soto, Rinc, and Otero. You get a bit of the
            sound of others dining – especially since COVID-19, more people eat outside –
            mixed with the sounds of doors unlocking and opening, and bird song.

      ## EVGR B Courtyard

      Between two extrusions in EVGR B, there's a little couryard – there’s
      a grill, some trees (which house *very* chatty birds), a fire pit,
      and some benches for people to sit and work or gather at. (It’s also right
      next to a spot where you can pick up Color COVID tests!)

      I recorded this soundscape around 2PM on Tuesday 11/30, after dropping off a COVID test.

      ## EVGR Roundabout

      I don’t know if this roundabout has a name per se, but it’s next to EVGR,
      Mirrielees, Wilbur, and Casper Quad. You’ll hear a lot of cars here – more
      cars than people, actually, although you’ll get the passing conversation
      or sound of bikers.
